"""FYPA launcher shim.

The implementation lives in the :mod:`fypa` package — see ``fypa/cli.py`` and
its sibling modules. This three-line shim stays at the repository root so that
``python FYPA.py <subcommand> ...``, the PyInstaller spec
(``packaging/FYPA.spec``) and the Altium launcher (``packaging/Run_FYPA.pas``)
keep working unchanged while the modules themselves are tidied away under
``fypa/``.
