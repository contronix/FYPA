    Copper resistivity rises about 0.39 %/K, so a rail that dissipates real

    error compounds, because the extra resistance dissipates more power.
    With ``enabled`` set, :func:`solve` runs a fixed-point loop: solve,
    convert each triangle's areal power density into a local temperature
    rise, rescale that triangle's sheet conductance, re-solve, repeat until
    the temperature field stops moving.

    The thermal model is deliberately **local and lumped**: each triangle
    sheds its heat straight to ambient through
    ``heat_transfer_w_per_m2k`` (both board faces combined), so

        ΔT [K] = p [W/mm²] · 1e6 / h [W/(m²·K)]

    There is no lateral heat spreading — a hot neck does not warm its
    neighbours, and a copper pour does not act as the heatsink it really
    is. That makes the result an *upper* bound on local rise for small hot
    features and a reasonable estimate for broad ones. Modelling spreading
    properly needs a second Laplace solve for temperature on the same mesh
    with stackup thermal conductivities, which is a separate tier of work;
    this tier exists because it is cheap, honest about its assumptions and
    still captures the first-order effect that commercial DC-IR tools
    model and an isothermal solve misses entirely.

    ``h`` of 20 W/(m²·K) is typical for a bare board in still air counting

        ``laplace_operator`` pins them to v=0 so the system stays

    concatenated ``(rows, cols, vals)`` triple in GLOBAL vertex indices, ready
    for the single COO→CSC assembly alongside the network and ground stamps.

    Batched: all meshes' retained triangle-soup arrays are concatenated into
    one global vertex array and one global triangle array (each mesh's
    triangles offset into its ``vindex`` global-index range), then the whole
    board's half-cotangent weights are computed in ONE vectorised
    :func:`_half_cotangent` pass. This replaces the previous per-mesh
    ``ThreadPoolExecutor.map(laplace_operator, meshes)`` — on a board with tens
    of thousands of small meshes the per-mesh Python overhead (task dispatch, a
    ``scipy.coo_matrix`` object built and torn down per mesh, GIL-bound small
    numpy) dominated; one global pass removes all of it.

    The result is **bit-identical** to the per-mesh path (cross-checked in
    ``tests/test_laplace_batched.py``): triangles are concatenated in mesh
    order, so each vertex lives in one contiguous triangle block and the
    global ``np.add.at`` accumulates its diagonal in the same order the
    per-mesh scatter did; the final CSC is identical because off-diagonal
    duplicates (≤2 per edge) sum commutatively.

    ``tri_conductance`` (optional) overrides the per-mesh scalar with one
    sheet conductance **per global triangle**, in the concatenated triangle
    order :func:`global_triangle_arrays` produces. This is what the
    electro-thermal loop uses: copper that heats up becomes more resistive,
    and the rise is local (a hot neck, a via farm) rather than uniform over
    a layer. When it is ``None`` the original per-mesh scalar path runs
    unchanged and bit-identically.

    Note the diagonal differs subtly between the two paths. With a uniform
    per-mesh conductance, ``(Σ w_ij)·cond`` and ``Σ (w_ij·cond)`` are the
    same number, and the scalar path uses the former to stay bit-identical
    to the historical per-mesh assembly. With per-triangle conductance they
    are *not* the same, and only the latter gives a row that sums to zero
    (the discrete conservation property the FEM needs), so the
    per-triangle path accumulates the diagonal from the already-scaled
    off-diagonals.

    ``"lgmres+ridge"`` when the matrix is unsymmetric — MINRES requires
    symmetry), or
    ``"direct-best-effort"`` when nothing reaches tolerance and the least-bad
    direct solve is handed back. ``iterations`` is the iteration count for
    iterative methods (1 for direct), and ``residual_norm`` is ``||L·v - r||``
    against the original system — already needed for the fallback check, so
    it is handed back rather than recomputed by the caller.

    The MNA matrix assembled by this solver is **symmetric indefinite**:
    Laplacian + Resistor stamps contribute positive eigenvalues, and the
    VoltageSource and ground-constraint Lagrange rows contribute negative
    ones. A direct factorisation usually handles this without issue — but
    pathological topologies (small isolated meshes connected only by lumped
    elements, heavily fragmented power nets, weakly-coupled mesh components)
    push the matrix near-singular, at which point the factorisation gets
    small pivots and silently returns a solution with a huge residual. The
    Lagrange-multiplier rows (ground_node_current, VoltageSource currents)
    are particularly sensitive — they end up wildly wrong, propagating to
    nonsensical downstream voltages.

    Detection at every stage is the same check: the residual ``||L·v - r||``
    must fall below ``max(abs floor, rel_tol·||r||)``. Recovery is staged,
    cheapest first — a near-singular matrix can defeat one factorisation's
    pivoting but not another's, so a failed direct solve is retried with
    progressively more robust pivoting before the (slow) iterative fallback:

      1. PARDISO symmetric-indefinite (Bunch-Kaufman pivoting) — primary,
         when the matrix is symmetric and PARDISO is installed.
      2. PARDISO unsymmetric (full MKL pivoting) — stronger pivoting.
      3. SuperLU (partial pivoting).
      4. Jacobi-preconditioned MINRES, warm-started from the best direct
         solve and bounded by a wall-clock budget.
      5. MINRES with a Tikhonov ridge as a last resort.

    Each direct retry costs a few seconds — cheap insurance against a

    the direct solve it replaced. When ``row_describer`` is supplied and
