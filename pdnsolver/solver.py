        Orphan vertices — points Triangle preserved from the input that
        don't appear in any triangle (typically seed points that fell a
        hair outside the polygon due to FP) — are excluded.
        ``laplace_operator`` pins them to v=0 so the system stays
        non-singular, and a Connection that snapped onto one would dump
        its CurrentSource / coupling-Resistor stamps onto a hard-grounded
        node (e.g. J8 5A SINK landing on an orphan at exactly its pin
        (x, y) used to drag the bottom-layer +3V3 pad island to
        ~5/σ ≈ 2.4 mV). Membership uses the flat ``_in_triangle_mask``;
        legacy meshes without that mask fall back to the half-edge

    ``method_used`` is one of ``"pardiso"`` (MKL PARDISO, when installed),
    ``"superlu"`` (scipy's direct solver), ``"minres"`` (Jacobi-preconditioned)
    or ``"minres+ridge"`` (Jacobi-preconditioned with Tikhonov regularisation
    as a final fallback), ``iterations`` is the iteration count for iterative
    methods (1 for direct), and ``residual_norm`` is ``||L·v - r||`` measured
    against the original system — already needed here for the fallback check,
    so it is handed back rather than recomputed by the caller.

    The MNA matrix assembled by this solver is **symmetric indefinite**:
    Laplacian + Resistor stamps contribute positive eigenvalues, and the
    VoltageSource and ground-constraint Lagrange rows contribute negative
    ones. SuperLU usually handles this without issue — but pathological
    topologies (small isolated meshes connected only by lumped elements,
    heavily fragmented power nets, weakly-coupled mesh components) push
    the matrix close to singular, at which point SuperLU silently returns
    a solution with a huge residual. The Lagrange-multiplier rows
    (ground_node_current, VoltageSource currents) are particularly
    sensitive — they end up wildly wrong, which propagates to nonsensical
    downstream voltages.

    Detection: after the direct solve, compute the relative residual
    ``||L @ v - r|| / ||r||``. If it's larger than a tight tolerance, the
    direct factorisation didn't actually converge — fall back to MINRES,
    which is the standard iterative solver for symmetric indefinite
    systems. Jacobi preconditioning (1/|diag|) cheaply improves the
    condition number and is usually enough.
