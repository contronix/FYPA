"""Altium copper geometry builder for FYPA.

Consumes an :class:`fypa.altium.extract.ExtractedProject` and produces one
:class:`GeometryLayer` per enabled copper layer. Each layer carries:

* a Shapely ``MultiPolygon`` of all filled copper on that layer
  (tracks ∪ arcs ∪ regions ∪ pads ∪ via barrels), with drill holes subtracted;
* a ``conductance`` in Siemens computed as
  ``copper_thickness_mm × COPPER_CONDUCTIVITY_S_PER_MM``, matching padne's
  surface-conductivity convention so the geometry can be handed straight to a
  2D Laplace solver.

Units: millimetres everywhere. Conductivity is therefore in S/mm (not S/m).

Geometry rules
--------------
* **Tracks** with ``is_keepout`` are skipped, as are ``is_polygon_outline``
  tracks belonging to a *solid* pour (boundary artwork over the region fill).
  A hatched or outlines-only pour keeps its perimeter — there the tracks are
  the copper. The remaining tracks are buffered LineStrings of half-width
  with round caps.
  Tracks on layer id ``MULTI_LAYER_PAD_LAYER_ID`` (74) with an assigned net
  appear on every enabled **signal** copper layer; internal planes are
  excluded. Unassigned (``NO_NET``) ones are omitted.
* **Arcs** are discretised to a polyline whose chord error is bounded by
  :data:`ARC_CHORD_TOLERANCE_MM`, then buffered with round caps. Multi-layer
  arcs follow the same net-assignment rule as tracks.
* **Regions** (Altium ``Regions6``) are included when ``kind == 0`` (copper),
  not a polygon outline, not a keepout, and not a board cutout. Multi-layer
  regions and fills with an assigned net appear on every enabled signal copper
  layer (internal planes excluded).
* **Pads** on layer id ``MULTI_LAYER_PAD_LAYER_ID`` (74) are through-hole and
  appear on every copper layer; SMT pads appear only on their assigned layer.
  Drill holes are subtracted from the pad shape.
* **Vias** span the inclusive range ``[layer_start, layer_end]`` along the
  enabled copper stack; the barrel is the outer disc minus the drill hole.
* **Plane layers** (``stackup.is_plane``) are flooded with their net's copper
  over the board outline (see :func:`_plane_sheet_polygon`). Anti-pad and
  thermal-relief detail around foreign-net through features is a deferred
  fidelity refinement; it does not affect per-net connectivity.

    separately (see :func:`build_per_net_geometry_layers_split`) can share

    The result is memoised on the project's identity (see

    at least twice over the same extraction — the viewer's stub-metadata build
    and ``build_problem`` — and the polygons it returns are a pure function of
    ``(proj, enabled_layers, include_vias)``. Callers treat the returned dict

    ``only_nets`` / ``exclude_nets`` restrict the sweep to a subset of net
    indices *before* any buffering happens. The FEM needs only the handful of
    rails a directive touches, while the other few thousand (layer, net)
    pairs exist purely for the viewer's "all copper" overlay — so buffering
    every track, arc, pad and via on the board to assemble a Problem that

    Filtering is a pure prefilter: the result is exactly the subset of the

    Only the *unfiltered* result is memoised, and a filtered request is
    served by subsetting that memo when it is present. That keeps both wins:

    the active rails never pays for the rest.
