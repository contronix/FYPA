"""FYPA loader — orchestrates extract + geometry + annotations.

Public entry: :func:`load_project`. Returns a :class:`LoadedProject` bundle
containing everything the downstream FEM stage needs:

* the raw extraction snapshot (for debugging / introspection),
* the per-layer Shapely geometry with conductance,
* the parsed annotation directives, with pin sets resolved to PCB locations.

This module deliberately stops short of building padne ``Network`` /
``Connection`` objects directly — the padne port (Stage 5+) will translate
``DirectiveSpec`` → padne lumped-element networks once the C++-replacement

#
# Physically this represents the IC package's internal pin-to-pin resistance
# (bond wires + die metal + on-die supply trace), which is typically in the
# 10-100 mΩ range for power pins. Using a value that is *too small* (e.g.
# 1 mΩ) causes a critical pathology: when the same chip has multiple power
# pads landing on different mesh nodes that naturally settle at slightly
# different voltages (a normal IR drop of just a few mV), the tiny coupling
# resistance drives a huge equalisation current between the pads (I = ΔV/R
# → 5 mV / 1 mΩ = 5 A circulating per coupling). With several multi-pin
# sinks this can dominate the solve: tens of amps of phantom circulating
# current flow through any series element supplying the rail (e.g. a
# ferrite bead), making it appear to drop several volts when the real
# sink current is only a few amps.
#
# 100 mΩ is a physically reasonable default — bounds the equalisation

# currents: an 80 A SOURCE split across 8 pins flows 10 A per pin × 0.1 Ω
# = 1 V drop, dragging the visible source-pad voltage to 0 V (the user's
# observed bug). 1 µΩ keeps the drop in the µV range regardless of pin
# current and doesn't introduce the "phantom equalising current" pathology

    A sub-piece is **kept** if either:

    * it contains at least one directive pin (SOURCE / SINK / REGULATOR /
      SERIES — anything that injects or draws current), OR
    * it contains at least one via coupling (which ties it into the rest
      of the stack — see below).

    Otherwise the piece has **no pins and no vias**: it is a truly
    floating island with no connection to anything, so the FEM has no way
    to reference it (its Laplacian's constant null-space is unconstrained)
    and the solver would emit an arbitrary potential. Those pieces are
    dropped and shown as neutral grey stub overlays instead.

    A piece with a **single via and no pins** is a *dead-end* island: no
    current flows through it (the one via is its only connection), but it
    is NOT rank-deficient — the via barrel resistor anchors the island's
    constant mode to the node it bridges to, so the island equilibrates to
    that far-side voltage at zero current. That is a physically meaningful,
    cleanly-solvable result, and the user wants to see it: the island
    should take the voltage of the layer it vias down to (with a flat,
    no-gradient via), not be excluded and mis-coloured by a nearest-copper
    probe. So we KEEP single-via pieces and let the FEM solve them.

    The real guard against genuinely-floating sub-systems (a piece whose
    via only reaches other undriven copper, never a directive) is
    :func:`_drop_unreachable_layers`, which BFS-walks the via-coupling
    graph from every directive and drops any slab it can't reach — and the
    solver's own connectivity/grounding handles whatever survives. Neither
    depends on this per-piece via count, so requiring a "closed loop" of
    two vias here only ever did harm: it deleted solvable dead-end islands.

    This applies even when the shape is a single connected polygon. The
    active-nets filter only checks whether the NET is active (has a
    driver on any physical layer); a single polygon on a DIFFERENT
    physical layer with no pins and no vias would otherwise pass into the
    FEM as an isolated sub-system, producing garbage voltages.

    Returns ``(filtered_shape, dropped_pieces)``. The filtered shape is
    an empty MultiPolygon if every piece was dropped. ``dropped_pieces``
    is the list of stub Polygon objects that were excluded — the caller
    ships these to the viewer so the user can still SEE the copper
    rendered as a neutral grey overlay (otherwise the copper just
    disappears from the heatmap, which is misleading).

    A (layer, net) slab is *reachable* if it either:

    * has a direct connection from a SOURCE / SINK / REGULATOR / SERIES
      directive, OR
    * can be reached by traversing via-coupling resistor edges from a
      reachable layer.

    Slabs that satisfy neither condition are isolated sub-systems in the
    FEM — the linear solver has no forcing function for them and produces
    arbitrary (often 0 V or wildly wrong) potentials.  This is the
    underlying cause of "huge voltage drop in copper with no current
    path": the slab has 2+ via footprints touching it (so it passes the
    per-piece stub filter), but those vias only connect it to other
    isolated slabs, never to a directive.

    Dropped slabs are moved into ``stub_pieces_by_pair`` so the viewer
    still renders them as a neutral grey overlay (the copper physically
    exists — it just carries no FEM-computed current).

    Coupling networks that reference a dropped layer are also removed so

    A SERIES directive with resistance below
    :data:`NET_MERGE_RESISTANCE_THRESHOLD_OHM` is treated as a wire link
    between two nets — its R value is the user's approximation of "0 Ω".
    Modelling such a link as a tiny lumped Resistor between two large
    copper bodies in the FEM creates a fragile two-net topology that the
    direct linear solver handles poorly (large ground-balancing currents,
    huge residuals). Merging the two nets into one eliminates the lumped
    element entirely — the rail becomes a single FEM net with one mesh
    per physical layer, the solver is well-conditioned, and the user's
    "this is a wire" intent is faithfully represented.

    Canonical-selection heuristic per equivalence class (in priority order):

      1. **Most user references** — pick the net name that appears most
         often in raw ``PDN_*_NET`` parameters. The user keeps writing
         that name in their annotations, so it shouldn't get renamed away.
      2. **Shorter name** — generic ground names (``0V``, ``GND``) tend
         to be short.
      3. **Lower index** — final deterministic tiebreak.

    Returns ``(net_remap, skipped_designators)``:
      * ``net_remap`` — ``{non_canonical_net_index: canonical_net_index}``.
      * ``skipped_designators`` — designators of the merged SERIES
        directives. These are excluded from the second annotation parse
        because, after merging, both pins land on the same net and
