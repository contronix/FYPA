"""Turn FYPA editor-mode directives into solver-ready annotation specs.

Editor mode (see :mod:`fypa.project_file`) lets the user place PDN sources /
sinks without editing the Altium schematic. Those edits live in the ``.fypa``
project file as :class:`~fypa.project_file.EditorDirective` records.

Before a re-solve, :func:`apply_editor_directives` converts each editor
directive into a real :class:`~fypa.altium.annotations.SourceSpec` /
:class:`~fypa.altium.annotations.SinkSpec` / :class:`~fypa.altium.annotations.ResistorSpec`
and appends it to the loaded
project's :class:`~fypa.altium.annotations.AnnotationResult`. From there
:func:`fypa.altium.loader.build_problem` treats it exactly like a schematic
directive — it meshes the referenced nets and stamps the lumped element.

    """Promote user-named unnamed-copper pieces into real nets on
    ``loaded.extracted``, in place.

    Each :class:`~fypa.project_file.CopperName` pins a single anchor on
    a single copper layer to a user-given net name. ``loaded.extracted``
    surfaces unassigned copper with ``net_index == NO_NET``; this
    function finds the connected component of NO_NET geometry on the
    rename's layer that contains the anchor, appends a fresh
    :class:`~fypa.altium.extract.RawNet` carrying the new name, and
    re-points every NO_NET primitive overlapping that component at the
    new net. The bucketing in
    :func:`fypa.altium_geometry.build_net_layer_shapes` then routes
    those primitives into the new net's FEM slab instead of dropping
    them as NO_NET.

    Returns a list of human-readable warnings for renames whose anchor
    didn't sit on a NO_NET polygon (e.g. the user named copper and then
    the underlying design changed); the rename is skipped, not fatal.

    The mutation uses :func:`dataclasses.replace` because
    :class:`~fypa.altium.extract.ExtractedProject` is a frozen
    dataclass — the result is a brand-new tuple of nets / regions /
    tracks / etc., and ``loaded.extracted`` is rebound to it.
