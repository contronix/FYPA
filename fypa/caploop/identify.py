"""Decoupling-capacitor identification and per-cap geometry bundling.

Finds every decoupling capacitor (a two-terminal C-designator component
connected across two power rails, where GND counts as a rail), associates
each side's escape vias, selects the reference plane-pair cavity, and parses
the informational part values — everything the tier engines and the
Capacitors tab consume.

Detection is heuristic (designator prefix ``C`` + digit, exactly two nets,
both rail-grouped) with per-cap user overrides layered on top: an exclude
drops a detected cap from the analysis (kept in the list, ``included=False``,
so the GUI can show it greyed out), an include forces a structurally-valid
cap through even when its nets aren't in any annotated rail group.

    is unit-ambiguous (µF by convention, F by SI) and is skipped rather than

    (only "16V"-style tokens count as voltages); ``exclude_char`` drops
    tokens containing it (a "0.5V" token must not be read as 0.5 F).

    Every token is tried **standalone first**, and only if none parses are
    bare numbers retried joined to the token that follows. The order matters:
    an Altium comment often puts the case code before the value ("CAP CER 0402
