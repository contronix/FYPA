"""Lean numeric-arrays representation of a padne ``Solution``.

padne's :class:`pdnsolver.solver.Solution` carries the full half-edge mesh
data structure (Vertex / Face / HalfEdge objects with cross-references).
That's exactly the right shape for the solver and the original padne UI,
but pickling it is wildly wasteful — a 71-vertex mesh balloons to ~42 KB
of pickle metadata when the actual data is ~2 KB of (x, y) floats and
triangle indices.

This module defines a parallel "lean" representation that stores only
the numpy arrays the viewer actually reads, and an adapter
:func:`to_lean_solution` that converts a padne Solution into it. Cache
pickles go from ~240 MB → ~3 MB on a typical 8-layer mid-sized board,
and load times drop from seconds to ~100 ms.

The viewer was refactored to consume the lean format directly, so all
new pickles are lean. The load path also accepts legacy padne pickles
and converts them on the fly for backward compatibility.
