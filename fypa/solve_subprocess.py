"""Run the heavy FEM solve in a child process.

The GUI normally solves on a :class:`QThread` (``_SolveWorker``). That works,
but the solve holds native scipy/Triangle sections that don't yield the GIL and
can't be interrupted cooperatively, so cancelling mid-solve historically forced
a ``QThread.terminate()`` that could orphan the solver's module-level locks (see
the 1d/1e cancel-path bugs). Running the solve in a *separate process* removes
that hazard structurally: the solver's caches and locks live in the child, and
cancelling simply kills the child — nothing in the parent can be left locked.

This module is deliberately **PySide-free** so it can be imported and executed
in a spawned child without pulling Qt into that process. The parent
(``altium_viewer._SolveWorker``) calls :func:`run_solve_in_subprocess`, which
spawns the child, forwards its progress messages to the caller's callbacks, and
returns the lean ``(solution, metadata)`` — only the compact
:class:`~fypa.lean_solution.LeanSolution` crosses the process boundary, never the
heavy half-edge padne solution (the child runs ``to_lean_solution`` itself, the
same 80×-shrink the on-disk cache relies on).

Trade-off vs. the in-process path: a fresh child per solve does not inherit the
in-memory mesh/Laplacian/PARDISO caches, so a value-only re-solve can't reuse a
warm factorisation here. It also pickles the (post-override) ``LoadedProject``
into the child. It is therefore opt-in — the parent enables it only when
``FYPA_SOLVE_SUBPROCESS`` is set — and the in-process QThread path remains the
default.
