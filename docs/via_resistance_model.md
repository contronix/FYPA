# How FYPA Models Vias

This document describes how FYPA represents vias and plated through-hole
(PTH) pads in the FEM solve, how their inter-layer (barrel) resistance is
calculated, which inputs go into that calculation, and what is *not*
modelled. It is aimed at users who want to understand or sanity-check the
numbers the tool reports in the **Vias** tab and the per-segment current
overlay.

The authoritative implementation lives in
[fypa/altium/loader.py](../fypa/altium/loader.py); section anchors in this
document point at the relevant ranges.

## Where vias fit into the FEM

The FEM is per-(physical-layer, net) — every enabled copper layer is
triangulated as an independent 2-D Laplace problem. Vias and PTH pads are
the only objects that couple voltages between layers. For each via, FYPA
inserts a chain of small `Resistor` elements (one per layer-to-layer
"hop") into the padne `Problem`, with each resistor terminating on a
Steiner point at the via's `(x, y)` on the two layer meshes it bridges.

See `_coupling_networks` in
[fypa/altium/loader.py:846-976](../fypa/altium/loader.py#L846-L976) for the
exact element-construction code.

## Per-hop resistance formula

For one layer-to-layer hop, the barrel resistance is

```
R_wall = ρ_cu(T) * L_hop / A_annulus

A_annulus = π * ((d/2)² − ((d − 2t)/2)²)
```

(the cross-section of the plated barrel — drill diameter minus the
unplated centre void).

If the via has an IPC-4761 fill **with a conductive material** (copper
paste, silver epoxy, electroplated-copper fill, etc. — see
[Conductive-fill model](#conductive-fill-model)), a second rod of fill
material is added in parallel:

```
R_fill = ρ_fill * L_hop / A_inner

A_inner = π * ((d − 2t)/2)²

1/R_hop = 1/R_wall + 1/R_fill
```

For a plain (or non-conductively-filled) via the fill branch is skipped and
`R_hop = R_wall`.

If the drill is smaller than twice the plating (e.g. via-in-pad with full
plating closure), the annulus formula gives a non-positive area and the
barrel collapses to a **solid copper rod**:

```
A = π * (d/2)²
```

This branch keeps the formula valid for tiny micro-vias whose plating
effectively fills the hole. (There is no separate fill term in this case —
the void no longer exists.) See `_barrel_segment_resistance_ohm` in
[fypa/altium/loader.py](../fypa/altium/loader.py).

A through-hole pad with a 0 mm hole, or a missing stackup, or any other
degenerate input falls back to a fixed per-hop value (see
[Fallback behaviour](#fallback-behaviour)).

## Conductive-fill model

FYPA reads the IPC-4761 protection record on every via and classifies the
fill as **conductive** or **non-conductive** before solving:

* A via must have one of the IPC-4761 *FILLING* protection types
  (V, VIa, VIb, VII — enum values 9, 10, 11, 12; value 5 is also accepted as
  a synonym for the V *filling* type, for resilience against `altium_monkey`
  enum reorderings). Tenting, plugging, and capping are not fills and leave
  the barrel cross-section unchanged.
* The FILLING feature row's material string (free text in Altium, e.g.
  `Copper`, `Silver Epoxy`, `Polymer`, `Non-Conductive Epoxy`) is matched
  case-insensitively against the keywords *conductive*, *copper*, *Cu*,
  *silver*, *Ag*. A leading "non-conductive" prefix disqualifies the row
  even if it contains "copper" downstream.
* A filled via whose material is empty or unrecognised is treated as
  **non-conductive** (the epoxy default). This is conservative — it leaves
  the resistance unchanged rather than silently shunting current down an
  invisible fill rod.

When classified as conductive, `R_fill` is computed from a single
user-tunable bulk resistivity:

| Setting                          | Default     | Equivalent                                |
|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Conductive fill resistivity      | 5×10⁻³ Ω·mm | 5×10⁻⁴ Ω·cm = 500 µΩ·cm (~300× copper)    |

The default approximates a typical silver-loaded thermosetting epoxy.
Pure electroplated copper-fill closure ≈ copper itself (1.68 µΩ·cm) —
drop the setting to ~2×10⁻⁵ Ω·mm in that case.

The classifier and per-hop helper live in
[fypa/altium/loader.py](../fypa/altium/loader.py) (`_is_conductive_fill`
and `_barrel_segment_resistance_ohm`).

### How much does it actually move R?

For a 0.3 mm drill, 1 mm hop, 25 µm plating:

| Configuration                    | R_hop                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Plain (no fill)                  | 0.778 mΩ                |
| Silver-epoxy fill (5×10⁻³ Ω·mm)  | 0.772 mΩ (~0.7 % lower) |
| Copper-paste fill (~8×10⁻⁵ Ω·mm) | ~0.4 mΩ                 |
| Pure copper fill (1.7×10⁻⁵ Ω·mm) | ~0.13 mΩ                |

The silver-epoxy result is barely measurable — the fill is ~300× more
resistive than the copper wall, so almost all current still flows in the
plating. Conductive fills only meaningfully change `R_hop` when their
resistivity is within an order of magnitude of copper.

Concretely, all of these answers are "yes":

* **Distance between the layers it hops** — yes. `L_hop` is the absolute
  z-difference between the *centres* of the two copper layers, computed
  from the Altium stackup's `copper_thickness_mm` and
  `dielectric_thickness_mm`. See `_layer_z_centers_mm` in
  [fypa/altium/loader.py:638-669](../fypa/altium/loader.py#L638-L669).
  Edits to the stackup made through the viewer feed straight into this.

* **Diameter of the via** — yes. The drill diameter (`hole_diameter_mm`)
  is taken directly from the Altium via record. (Note: this is the hole,
  not the via pad diameter — the pad diameter does not enter the model.)

* **Copper resistivity setup** — yes. The 20 °C reference resistivity is
  a user setting, as is the temperature coefficient α used to slide it.

* **Temperature setting** — yes. Changing *Board temperature* recomputes
  `ρ_cu(T)` for every hop on the next solve. The same temperature-
  corrected `ρ` is also applied to the plane-sheet conductivity on every
  copper layer — so via resistance and copper sheet resistance stay
  consistent.

[fypa/altium_viewer.py:17241-17296](../fypa/altium_viewer.py#L17241-L17296).

## Where each hop "lands"

For a multi-layer via, FYPA only chains the via through layers where the
via's nominal net **actually has copper covering the via's (x, y)**. This
matters in two ways:

* Inner layers that the net does *not* reach (the via just passes by) are
  skipped — they get no Steiner coupling point, so no phantom current can
  flow there.
* If fewer than two layers in the via's `layer_start..layer_end` span
  actually carry net copper at the via, the via is dropped from the FEM
  entirely (it has no closed-loop electrical role).

The reasoning is documented inline at
[fypa/altium/loader.py:846-976](../fypa/altium/loader.py#L846-L976).

Through-hole **pads** are treated the same way as vias, but with an
assumed span of *every enabled copper layer* (Altium pads do not carry an
explicit blind/buried span). See `_via_through_holes` at
[fypa/altium/loader.py:977-1012](../fypa/altium/loader.py#L977-L1012).

## Does Altium report whether the via is filled?

Yes — Altium stores quite a lot of "what is in / around the hole"
information in its PCB records, including:

* **IPC-4761 fill type** (`ipc4761_via_type`) and per-feature
  side/material rows: `Ia`, `Ib`, `IIa/IIb`, `IIIa/IIIb`,
  `IVa/IVb`, `Va/Vb`, `VI`, `VII` — i.e. tented, plugged, filled-and-
  plated-over, etc. Parsed by
  [altium_monkey/.../altium_record_pcb__via.py](../altium_monkey/src/py/altium_monkey/altium_record_pcb__via.py).
* **Soldermask tenting** flags (`is_tent_top`, `is_tent_bottom`).
* **Backdrill parameters** (`backdrill_params`) and a `via_mode` byte that
  distinguishes through, blind, and buried geometry.

**What FYPA does with that information today:** the PCB extractor
([fypa/altium/extract.py](../fypa/altium/extract.py)) propagates the
IPC-4761 type and the FILLING row's material string onto `RawVia` so the
resistance model can apply the conductive-fill shunt described above.
Tenting, backdrill, and the remaining IPC-4761 feature rows (covering,
plugging, capping) are still discarded — they do not change the conducting
cross-section of the barrel, so leaving them out of the model is exact for
DC resistance.

Per-via the extractor surfaces:

```
center, diameter_mm, hole_diameter_mm, layer_start, layer_end, net_index,
ipc4761_via_type, fill_material
```

The viewer's Vias tab shows the IPC-4761 fill column for every via;
conductively-filled rows carry a "·" suffix so it is visually obvious
which vias' `R_hop` includes the parallel-shunt model.

### Behaviour by IPC-4761 type

* A **non-conductive fill** (the most common IPC-4761 case for via-in-pad
  designs — epoxy, polymer, "Non-Conductive Paste") changes the barrel
  cross-section by adding a non-conducting rod inside the void. DC
  resistance is unchanged. FYPA's classifier rejects the row and falls
  back to the wall-only formula, which matches reality.
* A **conductive** (copper-paste / silver-paste / electroplated-copper)
  fill adds a second conducting rod in parallel with the plated wall.
  FYPA models this with the parallel-shunt formula above; the magnitude
  of the change depends on `ρ_fill` (see the worked numbers under
  [Conductive-fill model](#conductive-fill-model)).
* **Tented / covered / plugged / capped** vias just close the ends. The
  barrel itself is unchanged, so DC resistance is unchanged and FYPA
  treats them as unfilled vias.
* **Backdrilled** vias have the unused stub removed. Removing the stub
  has no DC effect on the current that flows between the layers it still
  connects, but a backdrilled via that the tool *thinks* still spans the
  full board might also have its (x, y) "covered" by the net on a layer
  that, post-backdrill, is no longer physically connected. In the
  pathological case this could overstate the connectivity. If you rely on
  backdrills, treat FYPA's via current as an upper bound on the affected
  net.

## Fallback behaviour

A fixed per-hop resistance (`fallback_via_resistance_ohm`, default
1.0 mΩ) is substituted whenever the physical model cannot produce a
sensible number:

* The drill diameter is missing or 0 mm (e.g. an Altium PTH pad with no
  hole size set).
* The stackup has no z-data for one of the two layers being hopped, so
  `L_hop` cannot be computed.
* The plated-barrel cross-section comes out non-positive after the solid-
  rod fallback. In practice this only happens when both `d` and `t` are
  zero.

Most boards never trigger the fallback. When they do, every affected
segment is logged at DEBUG level (`Skipped …` lines from
`_coupling_networks`) and shown with `R_hop = fallback` in the per-via
segment records that the viewer's Vias tab consumes.

This degrades gracefully — the solve still produces a result; vias whose
geometry is unknown just look like 1 mΩ short hops rather than failing
the solve outright.

## Assumptions and limitations

1. **DC-only.** The model is pure DC resistance. Skin effect, frequency-
   dependent inductive coupling, and high-frequency loss are not
   represented.
2. **Plated through-hole geometry only.** Every via and PTH pad is
   modelled as a hollow plated cylinder with a user-set wall thickness.
   FYPA does not distinguish blind, buried, or stacked microvias from
   through-hole vias at the resistance-model level — only the
   `layer_start..layer_end` span is respected when chaining layer hops.
3. **Constant plating thickness across the board.** A single
   `plating_thickness_mm` value applies to every via on every layer.
   Designs with mixed plating (e.g. heavy-copper outer vs standard inner)
   are not represented.
4. **Limited fill / cap / tent modelling.** Capping, tenting, and
   plugging are ignored — they do not change the conducting cross-section
   of the barrel and are exact for DC. **Conductive fills** (copper /
   silver paste, electroplated-copper closure) *are* modelled as a
   parallel rod inside the plated wall (see
   [Conductive-fill model](#conductive-fill-model)). Non-conductive
   epoxies and polymer fills are deliberately ignored — they do not
   change DC R.
5. **No backdrill awareness.** A backdrilled stub is still treated as
   electrically connected up to `layer_end`. Use with care on backdrilled
   designs.
6. **Layer centres, not surfaces.** `L_hop` is measured between the
   *centres* of two copper layers — i.e. it includes half of each copper
   thickness plus the full dielectric between them. This is the physically
   reasonable choice (current must traverse the bulk of each copper layer
   on its way to the in-plane mesh), but a thicker copper layer therefore
   contributes more to the barrel length than a thinner one with the
   same dielectric below it.
7. **Pad diameter is irrelevant.** Only the drill is used for the barrel
   cross-section. The annular ring on each layer does not enter
   `R_hop` — it is captured separately as part of that layer's 2-D copper
   mesh.
8. **Fallback is not an error.** A via that hits the fallback path
   produces a plausible 1 mΩ-per-hop result; the solve does not crash.
   The DEBUG log is the only signal that the physical model was bypassed
   — check it if a board has unexpectedly low IR drop.

Solver-side constants (`PLATING_THICKNESS_MM`, `COPPER_RESISTIVITY_OHM_MM`,
`FALLBACK_VIA_RESISTANCE_OHM`) are patched in
[fypa/altium/loader.py:227-230](../fypa/altium/loader.py#L227-L230) when
the user re-runs the solver from the Settings tab, so the next solve
picks up the new values without code changes.
