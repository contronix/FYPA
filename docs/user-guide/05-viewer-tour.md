# 5. The viewer tour

Once FYPA has solved your PDN, the viewer is where you spend the rest
of your time. This section walks through the layout, the tabs on the
side panel, the display modes, and the interactions worth knowing.

> The first four sections all assume you have a solved project open in
> the viewer. If you have not got that far yet, start with
> [Section 1.6](01-sources-and-sinks.md#16-importing-into-fypa).

## 5.1 Layout overview

A row of tabs runs across the top — **Heatmap**, Setup, Topology,
Nodes, Vias, Messages, Settings and Help. The **Heatmap** tab, where
you spend most of your time, is itself split into three areas:

- **Control panel (left)** — the Heatmap tab's controls, top to bottom:
  the **Physical layers** list, the **Rails** list, the **Mode**
  dropdown, the **Board Features** toggles, and the **Colour scale**
  (scheme picker and Min / Max boxes).
- **Viewport (centre / right)** — the OpenGL canvas. Shows the current
  layer's copper, shaded by the current display mode. Pan with the
  mouse, zoom with the wheel.
- **Status bar (bottom)** — hover-probe readouts (the x / y / value /
  net / layer under the cursor) and short hints.

A small **colour-scale strip** is pinned to the bottom-left of the
viewport, with two draggable handles for clamping the display range.

The remaining tabs hold the node / via tables, the topology diagram,
solver messages, and settings — each is covered in its own section
below.

## 5.2 The Setup tab

The Setup tab is the control surface for what the viewport shows.
From top to bottom:

- **Layer picker** — every copper layer in the stackup. Click to
  switch which layer the viewport renders.
- **Rail picker** — every rail FYPA inferred from your `PDN_P_NET` /
  `PDN_N_NET` pairs. Click to switch which rail's voltage / current is
  shown.
- **Mode dropdown** — *Voltage*, *Voltage Drop*, *Current Density* or
  *Power Density* (see 5.4).
- **Colour-scheme picker** — the matplotlib colormap used to shade the
  mesh (default `viridis`).
- **Min / Max boxes** — type a value to clamp the colour scale, or
  drag the handles on the scale strip in the viewport.
- **Per-layer transparency buttons** — fade individual layers to see
  underlying copper.

> Use the **R** hotkey to toggle "rail-only" mode — hides everything
> except the selected rail's copper. Useful on a busy board where
> you want to see one rail without the visual noise of all the
> others.

## 5.3 The Topology tab

The **Topology** tab shows a **Flow diagram** of the PDN
simulation model — each `PDN_*` directive appears as a coloured box with
labelled input/output ports; wires connect ports that share the same net.
This is **not** the PCB layout; for spatial placement use the Heatmap tab.

- **Nodes** — one box per directive (SOURCE, SINK, REGULATOR, SERIES);
  the header shows the role colour and designator; the body shows the
  configured value (`PDN_V`, `PDN_I`, `PDN_R`, regulator gain).
- **Ports** — small connectors on the left (inputs) and right (outputs).
  Each port is labelled with the **physical PCB net name** from the pad
  assignment (the same names you see on the Heatmap and in the Nodes
  table), not the schematic `PDN_*_NET` text or the merged rail name from
  the Rails list. Ground ports are the exception: they keep the schematic
  name you gave them (`GND`, `AGND`, …). When one directive terminal ties
  several pads on different nets (multi-pin part), the port label lists
  every distinct net, comma-separated; hover the port for the full list if
  the label is truncated. Multi-channel parts show one net per channel row
  (`N1`, `N2`, …) — the net that row's wire actually carries.
- **Wires** — orthogonal links between ports on the same electrical net,
  each labelled once above the link. Real return nets meet a horizontal
  rail below the diagram, terminated by a schematic **GND** symbol
  (three decreasing bars). Single-net directives (ideal return) show only
  their power port and are marked *single-net* in the body.
- **Annotation errors** — errored directives get a red border and ⚠ marker.
- **Click a box** — jumps to that component's pad on the Heatmap
  (same as **Go ▶** on the Nodes tab).
- **Hover a box or port** — tooltip with the configured value.

### Navigation and zoom

The diagram is rendered as a **vector schematic** (SVG) and can be
panned and zoomed independently of the Heatmap viewport:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Scroll vertically** | Mouse wheel (no modifier). |
| **Scroll horizontally** | **Shift** + mouse wheel. |
| **Zoom** | **Ctrl** + mouse wheel (around the cursor), or the **+** / **−** toolbar buttons. |
| **Fit diagram** | **Fit** toolbar button, or **Ctrl+0** while the Topology tab is focused. |
| **Pan** | Middle-button drag, or hold **Space** and drag with the left button. |
| **Pan (keyboard)** | Arrow keys; hold **Shift** or **Ctrl** for larger steps. |

Keyboard zoom shortcuts (**Ctrl++**, **Ctrl+=**, **Ctrl+-**) work while
the Topology tab (or one of its controls) has focus.

> **Note:** Heatmap gestures differ — there the mouse wheel zooms the
> board view directly (see [Section 5.10](#510-interaction-reference)).
> On the Topology tab, plain wheel scrolls and **Ctrl**+wheel zooms,
> matching browser and document-viewer conventions.

## 5.4 The display modes

Switching the mode dropdown (or pressing **M** to cycle, **Shift+M**
to cycle back) changes what each mesh vertex's colour represents:

| Mode               | Units    | What it shows                                                                                  |
|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Voltage**        | V        | Absolute potential at every node. The hottest colour is the supply, the coldest is the return. |
| **Voltage Drop**   | V        | Signed drop relative to the rail's source. Useful for "how much voltage have I lost between J1 and U5?" |
| **Current Density**| A / mm   | Magnitude of the current density vector `|J|` at every node. Highlights bottlenecks. |
| **Power Density**  | W / mm²  | Resistive power dissipation per unit area. Highlights hot spots — where copper will warm up. |
| **Via Current**    | A        | Current through each via; the copper is drawn grey as context. |

> Current Density and Power Density tend to spike sharply at narrow
> tracks and pad corners. The colour scale auto-clips the top end on
> these modes so a single 10× spike does not flatten the rest of the
> board into one colour. Use the Min / Max boxes to override.

## 5.5 The Nodes tab

One row per terminal pin (every pad on every SOURCE / SINK /
REGULATOR / SERIES directive). Columns:

- **Designator / Pad** — which part, which pad.
- **Net** — the net this pin connects to.
- **V** — the solved voltage at this pin.
- **Min V**, **Margin**, **Status** — only populated for SINK pins
  that carry a `PDN_MIN_V` value
  (see [Section 1.3](01-sources-and-sinks.md#optional-pdn_min_v--minimum-acceptable-voltage-at-the-sink)).
  *Margin* is the measured voltage minus the minimum; rows with a
  negative margin are highlighted red with `Status = FAIL`.

The table is sortable — click a column header to sort by it. Sorting
by Margin ascending is the fastest way to find which pin is closest
to falling below its limit.

Right-click a SINK row and choose *Show fixes for …* to open the
**Fixes** tab on that load.

### The Fixes tab — where would copper help?

The heatmap shows where current flows. The **Fixes** tab answers the
question you ask next: *for this load, where would extra copper cut its
drop the most?* Copper carrying another load's current, or copper beyond
the load, scores nothing.

- **Loads** (left) — every SINK, worst first, by how much of its drop
  budget it uses. The budget is `nominal − PDN_MIN_V` when the sink has
  a `PDN_MIN_V`, otherwise 5 % of the rail's nominal voltage. Over-budget
  loads are red. The drop is the same number the design report shows.
- **Fixes** (right) — for the selected load, ranked by the voltage each
  would gain:
  - **Widen** — push this copper edge out by 0.25 mm. For a trace,
    either edge.
  - **Add layer** — a stitched parallel copy of the copper, same weight,
    on another layer. The layers with room for it are named.
  - **Add via** — another via beside this one.

  Fixes that would run into another net's copper are greyed and listed
  last. Click **Go** to jump to a fix on the heatmap.

**Show fixes on the heatmap** draws every fix of the selected load over
whatever mode the heatmap is in — a line along an edge to widen, a dashed
outline round copper to parallel, a ring on a via — numbered as in the
table. **Show value map** colours the heatmap by where parallel copper
would help the load most (volts gained per mm²) instead of the Mode
quantity; choosing a mode turns it off.

The ranking comes from one extra ("adjoint") solve per load, done with
the main solve, so it adds little to solve time. The estimates are
**first order**: they hold well for modest changes (a widen estimate on
a test trace was within 1 % of re-solving with the trace widened; a
parallel-layer estimate within 10 %) and are optimistic for large ones.
Re-solve to confirm a fix.

## 5.6 The Vias tab

One row per via on the board, with the current flowing through it.
Columns:

- **Net** — which net the via belongs to.
- **From / To** — the two layers it connects.
- **Current (A)** — the solved current through the via.

Sort by Current descending to spot vias that are carrying too much —
a 0.3 mm hole carrying 2 A is a future failure. The
[via resistance model](../via_resistance_model.md) covers how those
currents are computed.

## 5.7 The Messages tab

Warnings and diagnostics from the loader and solver — anything that
did not abort the run but is worth knowing about. Examples:

- Net names referenced in `PDN_*` parameters that were not found on
  the PCB (and were therefore skipped).
- Editor directives that could not be applied (skipped, not aborted —
  see [Section 2.9](02-sources-and-sinks-editor.md#29-troubleshooting)).
- Solver warnings about near-singular matrices, suspicious gradients,
  etc.

Worth a glance after every solve. If everything is healthy, the tab
shows a short "no issues" message.

## 5.8 The Settings and Help tabs

- **Settings** — viewer-wide preferences (default colormap, marker
  visibility, hover-probe behaviour, theme).
- **Help** — built-in cheatsheet of hotkeys and gestures.

## 5.9 The Heatmap tab

The viewport itself lives in a tab called *Heatmap*. You will rarely
click away from it during normal use — the other tabs hold the setup
controls, node / via tables, messages, and settings.

## 5.10 Interaction reference

| Action                          | How                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pan                             | Left-click and drag in the viewport.                                 |
| Zoom                            | Mouse wheel.                                                         |
| Hover-probe a value             | Move the mouse over copper — the value (in the current mode's units) appears in the status bar, along with the net and layer. |
| Clamp the colour scale          | Drag the two handles on the colour strip, or type values into the **Min** / **Max** boxes on the Setup tab. |
| Click a piece of copper         | Selects it — the bottom bar reports the net, the area, and (where applicable) the layer-local current. |
| Click a marker                  | Reports the directive value (source voltage, sink current, etc.) in the bottom bar. |
| Left-drag on empty board (editor mode, 2D) | Rubber-band selects every PDN marker fully inside the box, for editing several sinks at once (see [Section 2.6](02-sources-and-sinks-editor.md#26-editing-several-sinks-at-once)). |
| Resolve after editor edits      | Click the green **↻ Resolve** button at the top-left of the viewport (see [Section 2.7](02-sources-and-sinks-editor.md#27-re-solving-and-saving)). |

## 5.11 Hotkeys worth remembering

| Key          | Action                                                                |

| **0**        | Reset the 3-D camera.                                                 |
| **E**        | Toggle editor mode (see [Section 2.2](02-sources-and-sinks-editor.md#22-entering-editor-mode)). |
| **S** / **L** | In editor mode, arm a free **S**OURCE / sink (**L**oad) drop — the keyboard equivalent of the red / blue triangle buttons. |
| **Ctrl+S**   | Save the project (the dialog offers project-only or project+solution). |

The Help tab inside the viewer has the authoritative, always-current
list — if a hotkey here looks wrong, that tab is the source of truth.
