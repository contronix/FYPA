# 7. Importing a board from Gerber files

FYPA can analyse boards that did not originate in Altium. If all you have
is a fabrication Gerber set — RS-274X copper layers plus an Excellon
drill file — you can import them directly. The rest of FYPA (meshing,
solver, viewer, editor mode, project file) works exactly the same; only
the input changes.

## 7.1 When to use Gerber import

- You did not author the board and have no Altium project for it.
- You are analysing someone else's reference design or a fab-house
  output set.
- You have an Altium project but want to sanity-check FYPA against a
  pure-Gerber view of the same board.

If you do have an Altium project, prefer [Section 1](01-sources-and-sinks.md).
The Altium path carries net names, pads, components, and any schematic
`PDN_*` directives — Gerber carries none of those.

## 7.2 What you need

| File                                  | Required | Purpose                                                       |
|---------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Copper Gerber for every layer         | Yes      | Top, Bottom, and any inner copper                             |
| NC-Drill (Excellon) file              | No       | Vias / through-holes; without it, multi-layer rails cannot bridge across layers |
| Board outline Gerber (`.GKO`, `Edge.Cuts`, etc.) | No       | Sets the board boundary on the viewer; falls back to copper bounding box |
| Approximate stackup                   | Yes      | Total board thickness + copper weight, used to compute conductance |

FYPA recognises Altium (`.GTL` / `.GBL` / `.G<n>` / `.GKO` / `.GTO`),
KiCad (`F.Cu` / `B.Cu` / `In<n>.Cu` / `Edge.Cuts`), and several common
generic naming conventions automatically. You can correct any
miscategorised file in the layer-mapping dialog.

## 7.3 The import flow

1. **File → Import Gerber Files…** (`Ctrl+G`) in either the launcher
   window or an already-open viewer.
2. **File picker.** Multi-select every Gerber and drill file in one go.
   Files outside the recognised extensions can still be picked — they
   will appear as "Ignore" in the next dialog and you can re-assign
   them.
3. **Layer-mapping dialog.** One row per picked file. Adjust any rows
   that came out wrong:
   - **Top** / **Inner 1..N** / **Bottom** — copper layers (must have
     exactly one Top and one Bottom; inner layers must be assigned
     contiguously from Inner 1).
   - **Top Silk** / **Bottom Silk** — accepted but currently unused.
   - **Outline** — the board boundary (only the first such file is
     used).
   - **Drill (Excellon)** — every Excellon file is parsed.
   - **Ignore** — file is dropped from the import.
4. **Stackup dialog.** Pre-filled defaults:
   - 1.6 mm total board thickness.
   - 1 oz copper (0.035 mm per layer).
   - Dielectric split evenly across the gaps.
   Edit the per-layer copper / dielectric thicknesses; click
   **"Apply weight + re-distribute dielectric"** to reset after a
   change. The values feed directly into the FEM conductance for each
   layer, so they don't have to be exact — they just have to be in the
   right ballpark.
5. **Viewer opens** with a blank heatmap (no solve has run yet) and
   the copper visible on every layer.

## 7.4 Adding sources and sinks

Gerber files have no schematic information, so the **only** way to add
PDN directives is the editor mode. The full editor walk-through is
[Section 2](02-sources-and-sinks-editor.md); the key differences for a
Gerber-imported board are:

- **Every copper island starts unnamed.** Gerber carries no nets, so
  every disjoint piece of copper appears as `(none)` until you give it
  a name. Use the **"Name copper"** flow (click on an island, give it a
  net name) before dropping a SOURCE / SINK / SERIES on it. A directive
  on un-named copper is silently dropped at solve time.
- **No "component-bound" directives.** The component picker in the
  editor panel is empty because Gerber has no PCB components — use
  free markers (the red SOURCE / blue SINK triangles) on copper islands
  instead.
- **Vias are reconstructed from the Excellon drill data only.**
  If you didn't supply a drill file, multi-layer rails will need either
  a SERIES directive bridging the two layers or a second source / sink
  on each layer.

Press **Resolve** to solve. The first Resolve replaces the
blank stub solution with a real heatmap.

## 7.5 Saving the project

`Ctrl+S` saves a `.fypa` project file alongside the Gerbers. The file
records:

- The Gerber and drill files used (paths relative to the `.fypa`).
- Your confirmed layer assignments.
- The stackup you entered.
- Every editor directive and copper-name rename you placed.

Opening the `.fypa` later via **File → Open Project File…** re-imports
the Gerbers using the saved settings — the layer-mapping and stackup
dialogs are skipped.

## 7.6 Limitations

- **Via diameter is a heuristic.** Gerber + Excellon carry only the
  drill diameter, not the pad annulus, so FYPA models each via barrel
  as drill + 0.3 mm. If your design uses unusually large or small
  annular rings, expect a few-percent error in IR drop.
- **No IPC-4761 fill metadata.** All vias are modelled as plated
  through-holes with a hollow barrel; conductive-fill shunts (which
  the Altium path can detect and model) are not available here.
- **No automatic SERIES element detection.** Without a schematic,
  there's no way to know that two named copper islands are connected
  through a ferrite or sense resistor — you must place a SERIES editor
  directive between them explicitly.
- **No component-bound directives.** As above, every editor directive
  on a Gerber project is a free marker.

If a board hits any of these limits hard enough to matter, the
recommended path is to re-create the board in Altium and use the
schematic-based flow.
